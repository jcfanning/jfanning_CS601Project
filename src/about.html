                        Hi there and welcome to my website. Iâ€™m Justin, an
                        amateur bread baker. I got my start a number of years
                        ago when I decided, with no prior baking experience, to
                        try my hand at a loaf of bread. Looking back I am not
                        particularly proud of the initial dense, unattractive,
                        and poorly risen loaves that I produced, but it was a
                        start. Through a bit more experimentation, reading, and
                        purchasing a scale I did finally manage to produce an
                        airy yeast based loaf. That success has fueled the many
                        loaves since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While looking for ways to improve upon the bread I was
                        making I eventually decided to try my hand at a
                        sourdough starter. Little did I know that I would still
                        be tending the same one 8-9 years later. The flavor and
                        longevity of of the sourdoughs were easily enough to get
                        me hooked on trying to bake exclusively naturally
                        leavened breads. It also gave me copious opportunities
                        to connect baking with my process engineering
                        background. Many spreadsheets and records have been
                        developed over the years to help refine recipes and keep
                        track of what I had done in the past. Some of them have
                        been adapted into tools found on this site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These days I certainly have my go to recipes, but still
                        find myself constantly making changes and trying
                        something new, just to see what happens.
