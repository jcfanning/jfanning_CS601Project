## Short Description:

In this assignment I have created a simple html based website about sourdough bread baking. No elements beyond basic html were used.

## To Run

To access the website, start up your favorite browser and then open the file: <b>"index.html"</b>

Alternatively, double clicking on <b>"index.html"</b> and choosing to open it with a web browser would also work.

## Error Checking Notes
- All pages passed the validator.w3.org "validate by Direct Import"
- "validate by File Upload" does not appear to work correctly, it claims to see characters before <!DOCTYPE html> in the about.html file.....however, <!DOCTYPE html> is the first line. it also claims character encoding is not declared, however line 4 of every file does just that
- I am assuming that I can trust the results given by the "validate by Direct Import" option


## Additional Notes
- This site was composed of 6 pages rather than just the 3 required.
- Forms were used on one page that will eventually have an interactive element with more than html is allowed
- The about page give some background as to why I wanted to create a site centered around bread baking
- real content was generated for all text fields
- multiple tables and lists(ordered and unordered) were used
- each page contained a number of semantic elements including <head>, <header>, <nav>, <main>,<footer>, <figure>, <table>
- included a Mailto link
- had to track down how to insert spaces between elements:  "&nbsp", to avoid a clustered look with just html formatting
